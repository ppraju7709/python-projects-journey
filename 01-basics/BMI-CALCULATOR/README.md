# BMI Calculator ⚖️

## Description
This project is a Python program that calculates the **Body Mass Index (BMI)**
of a person using their **height** and **weight**.

BMI is a simple health indicator used to understand whether a person has
a healthy body weight for their height.

## Calculation Formula
- **BMI = weight (kg) / (height (m) × height (m))**
- Height must be entered in **meters** or converted from centimeters

> Note: The BMI formula is the **same for both males and females**.

## BMI Categories
- **BMI < 18.5** → Underweight  
- **18.5 ≤ BMI < 24.9** → Normal weight  
- **25.0 ≤ BMI < 29.9** → Overweight  
- **BMI ≥ 30.0** → Obese
