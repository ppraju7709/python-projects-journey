# 🐍 Python Learning Journey – Projects Repository

Hi 👋

This repository represents **my personal Python learning journey**, where I am building projects step by step to strengthen my **core programming concepts, logic building, and problem-solving skills**.

I am focusing on **learning Python by doing**, starting from the basics and gradually moving towards **Object-Oriented Programming (OOP), Data Structures & Algorithms (DSA), and real-world applications**.

---

## 🎯 Purpose of This Repository

* To practice Python concepts through hands-on projects
* To build strong fundamentals in programming
* To improve logical thinking and problem-solving
* To document my learning progress publicly
* To create a clean and structured GitHub portfolio

## 📚 Concepts Covered

✔ Python Basics (loops, conditions, input/output)
✔ Lists, Strings, Tuples, Sets, Dictionaries
✔ Functions and Modules
✔ Built-in Modules (`random`, `time`, `datetime`)
✔ Object-Oriented Programming (OOP)
✔ Data Structures & Algorithms (DSA)
✔ Mini Real-World Applications

## 🧩 Project Structure

Each project folder generally contains:

* `main.py` – Python source code
* `README.md` – Explanation of the project

### Example Project README

```md
## Project Name

### Concepts Used
- Loops
- Conditions
- Lists / Dictionaries

### Description
Brief explanation of what the project does and what I learned from it.

### How to Run
python main.py
```

## 🚀 Learning Approach

> *I focus on consistency, clarity, and improvement rather than perfection.*

Some projects are simple, some are challenging — all of them contribute to my learning and growth as a Python developer.

---

## 📈 Progress Status

* Beginner → Intermediate (ongoing)
* Projects are added regularly as I learn new concepts
